XBRL version 0.01
=================

XBRL is an object oriented Perl module for reading XBRL instance 
documents. It seeks to both convert those documents into other formats 
(e.g. HTML) and make the contents of the XBRL instance generally 
available to other users without the need to completely understand 
the XBRL format. Because the XBRL standard is large and complex, the 
module currently implements only a subset of its features. The plan 
is to accrete functionality over subsequent releases until a complete 
and standards compliant implementation is achieved.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

XML::LibXML is a Perl interface to the Gnome project's libxml library
